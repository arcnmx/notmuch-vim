# notmuch vim

This is a vim plug-in that provides a fully usable mail client interface,
utilizing the notmuch framework.

This is a fork of [imain/notmuch-vim](https://github.com/imain/notmuch-vim).

[Ian Main](https://github.com/imain) added the following features in his fork:

* URI opening support.
* Attachment saving and opening support.
* Better patch saving support.
* Folded threading.
* Folded full headers available.
* Ability to tag all emails in a folder.
* Saves sent mail in your notmuch db.
* Better moving between messages in a thread.
* Better search listing.
* Better reply handling.
* ~~Automatically refresh folder index.~~
* Sending of attachments.

## What's special about this fork

I didn't do any useful change:

* Removed some features.
* Changed quotes, names and other things that shouldn't be changed.
* Added one line so that you can encrypt and sign mails.
* Remove the docs and other useful files.
* See for yourself.
